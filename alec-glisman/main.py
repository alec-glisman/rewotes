"""Main script that trains models using the XGBoostModels class.

The main function in this script is `main()`, which is responsible for
executing the script. It follows the steps mentioned above and does not
return any value.

To run this script, execute the `main()` function.

Example:
    python main.py

Note: Before running the script, make sure to provide the API key in a file
named "api_key.txt" located in the same directory as this script.
